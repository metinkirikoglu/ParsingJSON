This GitHub repository contains three Android activities that demonstrate basic concepts of using JSON. The applications are:

1. Displaying from Local String (FromLocalString activity):

This activity parses a JSON object from a String, and displays the name, surname, and age information into text view fields.

2. From Local Asset to ListView (FromAssetsToRecyclerView activity):

This activity retrieves JSON data from an asset file, parses it into objects, and populates a RecyclerView using an adapter.

3. From Local String to ListView (FromLocaleToListview activity):

This activity parses a JSON string from a local variable, populates a list to store the students, and displays the student information (name, surname, age) in a ListView.

Usage:

Clone or download the repository.
Open Android Studio and import the project.
Run the app and observe the functionality of each activity.
Code Explanation:

The JSON operations are performed in the onCreate method of each activity. The code uses JSONObject and JSONArray classes to parse JSON objects and arrays. The data is bound to text views, RecyclerView, or ListView depending on the activity.

Notes:

This code is intended to demonstrate basic concepts of JSON usage.
In real applications, you may encounter more complex JSON structures and data handling.
Remember to add comments for debugging and code improvement.
